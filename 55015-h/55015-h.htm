</div>

<p class='c006'>I remember the woman’s school at four years old, and the merited
chastisement of the school marm; my desperate descent on
the sugar bowl; the military company of which I was commander;
my annual cries in the trundle bed at 12 o’clock and one second,
A. M.: “I wish you merry Christmas, Ma,—I wish you
happy New Year, Pa,—now gim me cent;” with my father’s:
“Go to sleep, you young rascal, or I’ll come and spank you;” the
two cents I always got on the 4th of July, if I had been a good
boy, and the solitary penny if I hadn’t; the death of my mother
of twins; the copious tears of my father and Aunt Lucy; my
grief at her sudden demise; the country boarding school, and the
blast of lightning that felled me to the earth, while whittling on
the summer green; my eyes soon open on the glories of the lurid
universe, and I scamper into the pretty cottage, and bound into
the arms of my aunt, who nearly smothers me with affectionate
embraces; the storm passes; a bow appears, with crimson arrows,
and lingers on the concave’s rosy verge, till Venus gleams through
the twilight leaves, when its gorgeous hues are vailed by the revolving
spheres, and it descends the dazzling west.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whose Archer follows the resplendent sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before whose darts the stormy Furies run;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>the moon ascends the east in matchless splendor, and roams in
tranquil beauty through infinitude, spreading its snowy light on
vale and mead, that vie with lakes of liquid silver; my aunt lingers
at my bed, while I say my evening prayer, and invests my
heart with sacred feelings; myself and brother William, on our
way to school, through a dreary wood, espy a boy in a wagon,
when I exclaim: “Why, Bill, there’s our brother Albert;” Bill
stares and says: “Steve, your perceptions are very foggy, and I
begin to think you aint got good sense;” I closely scan the boy,
and smile, but elicit no response, the little rogue riveting his bright
blue eyes on the vacant air; Bill passes on to school, with:
“Steve, you are raving mad, and I’m going to tell Aunt Freeman
so;” when I address the stranger thus: “Little boy, you look like
my brother Albert, and this horse and wagon resemble ours, and
won’t you please to tell me if you aint my brother Al, who lives
far away from here, in a place called Providence? I always dearly
loved him, and I havn’t seen him for a long time now, and I would
like to see him very much; come, now, little boy, aint you Ally
Branch, and if you are, won’t you please to tell me so?” Tears
roll down his pale cheeks, followed by the sweetest smiles, (like
simultaneous rain and sunshine,) extending his arms, with: “How
do you do, dear brother Stevy;” I scream; dart into the wagon,
and, placing my arms around his neck, fondly kiss him. And then
I made the woods ring with my cries for Bill to return, and behold
our dear brother, found so mysteriously alone in the forest
wild. Bill slowly returns; and I hear the echo of a laugh, and see
a man emerge from the monarch oaks, whom I discern as father,
whose playful stratagem blares brightly before my enraptured
vision. And with the velocity of light, I spring from the wagon,
and at a bound, am in the embraces of my adored father. The
vail slowly passes from the eyes of Bill, who stands like a statue
in the dim perspective, crying lustily over my triumphant conquest.
We all shout and wave our hands, and Willie bounds into
Albert’s and father’s arms, whose fervent kisses soon dispel his
tears; when his crescent and revolving eyes gently threaten to
eclipse the sun and moon with hilarious splendor; three happy
brothers then rock the forest solitude with merry vociferations,
and run like deer, and sing like infant Jubals, with sweet responses
from congenial birds, prancing on the oaks’ majestic
branches. And with hearts of gladness, we spring like hounds
into the wagon, and return to Aunt Freeman’s, and that I regard
as one of the happiest days of my early boyhood. On the following
morn, we leave for Providence, which I scarcely reach, ere our
yard is a camp of boys, eager to embrace their favorite commander,
after his long captivity in the desert wilds of Woodstock; myself
and Albert soon go to another country school; we board with
a minister who has a large family, and a small salary, which was
tardily and scantily paid with very poor provisions; myself and
Al don’t like the fare; has fried pork too often for breakfast, and
pork and beans for dinner, with a cold cut of pork and beans at
nightfall; and we enter our solemn protest against so much fried
hog, and so many baked beans; we protest, too, against his not
fastening the doors and windows nights, as father does at home;
we hear strange noises nights, while abed; and respectfully implore
him to put locks on the doors, and nails in the windows, who
refuses, and says, that good boys are never afraid of robbers or assassins;
we still hear dreadful sounds at midnight; and bury ourselves,
head and all, in the bed clothes; sweat terribly, and nearly
smother; grow pale; lose flesh; get very weak; have cold night
sweats; finally despair, and threaten to leave for home; write
long letters to father, full of bad writing and spelling, who doesn’t
answer them, because he can’t read them; we start for Providence;
our sacred host pursues us on a cadaverous horse, whose ribs
rattle, and captures us in the haunted woods, where, in old times, a
man was murdered, and two lovers hung themselves, because their
parents wouldn’t let them marry; I and Al were hurrying through
this dreadful wood, when old cadaverous and the parson pounce
upon us, who threatens to whip us if we don’t return, and cuts a
switch for the purpose; his eyes roll terribly, and, as I once heard
he was slightly insane at times, and, fearing he might murder me,
I gave the wink to Al, and we concluded to return, very gently
shaking our heads and fists, with threats of telling our father all
about it some day, who was a Justice of the Peace, and could lock
up any body, and have them hung beside; to silence our unceasing
clamors, the parson gets some cheap second-hand locks, and rusty
nails, fastens the doors and windows nights, and gives us fried liver
twice a week for breakfast, and lets pork and beans slide awhile,
with very tender veal instead; don’t hear strange sounds at night
any more; sleep very soundly; don’t hear the cheerless midnight
winds as of yore; get fat as butter; are very contented; Fourth
of July close at hand; father comes after us; shed tears of joy,
and run and jump like wild cats, and get home alive once more
from a country boarding school; go to a party on the night of our
arrival; Oscar Rivulet and Clara Violet are there; at the party’s
close, I can’t find my hat, and while in its vigorous pursuit, Oscar
takes the arm of Clara, when I step up and whisper in his ear, that
I will chastise him the very next day for cutting me out; Oscar
and Clara depart; I find my hat in the oven, where Oscar doubtless
put it, and begin to cry with rage; to console me, my aunt
places the arm of Flora Rosebud in mine, who was a dashing little
belle, with whom I slowly ramble towards her home beneath a
brilliant sky; soon after I bid Flora good night, at her father’s
door, a dark cloud rapidly arose and obscured the moon, and I became
afraid, and ran fleetly home, expecting to meet an assassin at
every corner’s turn, but when I heard the cheerful watchman’s cry
of “half-past eight o’clock, and all’s well,” and beheld his noble
form in the distance, my fears are tranquilized, and I walk as erect
and firm as the hero of many battles, and loudly boast of my courage,
after I get snugly in the trundle bed with Albert, the shield of
my father’s voice above me, to fortify my pretended valor. On the
following day, my step-mother struck me on the head with a
jacket with brass buttons, for my impudence at dinner in my father’s
absence, because she wouldn’t give me more boiled onions, of
which I was very fond; the blood flowed freely, and she was terrified
lest I would bleed to death, and she be hung; she dressed
the wounds most tenderly, and gave me plenty of onions and sugar,
and warmly coaxed me not to tell father when he came to tea,
lest he would gently chide her for her laceration of the skull of the
prolific brain of the darling son who bore his own father’s promising
name of Stephen; and for many days she gave me candy and
peanuts, and gave me so many onions that I have loathed them
since; she even poulticed my lacerated head with boiled onions,
which I smell to this day; I had the ear-ache, and she even put a
small roast onion in my ear to check the pain; I once passed
through Weathersfield, (where onions are as thick as leaves in the
Vale of Vallambrosa,) whose atmosphere caused me to fertilize its
streets with bile; my step-mother finally stops my supplies of
sweetmeats, and I threaten to tell my father of her violent blow,
and show him my scars, when she surrendered, and gave me sweet
things for a long period; and she saved me many a whipping from
my father, when I was mischievous, lest I would tell and show the
relics of her trouncing, which gave me a boundless latitude for
pranks until the scars all passed away; at this time, my dog Watch
was drowned, but he rose the ninth day, and I buried him at the
foot of my father’s garden, with funeral honors, a neighboring dog,
in traces, bearing his precious body to the grave, over which I placed
turf and stones in memory of a dog I dearly loved; after the funeral,
Cornelius Snow, nicknamed Flop, called me names, and I
told my father that “Flop Snow had called me names, and I meant
to lick him for it,” when my father effected a reconciliation, by allowing
Cornelius to call me Steve as long as I called him Flop.
He had long been at the head of my class, at school, and I had never
been at the head, which mortified my father, who told me if I
would get above Flop through good spelling, he would give me a
sixpence; I tried long and hard, but I couldn’t do it; so, on a very
stormy day, while myself and Flop were the only boys of our
spelling class at school, I told him that if he would make a mistake
in spelling, and let me keep at the head until school was over,
I would give him three cents; Flop consented, and broke down
on beef, which he spelled <em>b-e-a-p-h-f-e</em>, for which the teacher boxed
his ears, and made him see ten thousand sparkling stars; I got
sixpence from my father, and gave Flop half of it; there was a full
class the next day, and down I went to the foot, my usual place;
my father learned of my collusion with Flop, and gave me a tremendous
whipping; the next day I went several miles down Providence
river, in a canoe with Elias Smith and Joseph Fuller, and
was gone four days, and all the town was terribly excited lest we
were lost; but Mr. Proud, a neighbor, of whose peaches and melons
I was very fond, stuck to it like beeswax, that I would never be
drowned, while hemp grew in Kentucky; the day after my return,
my step-mother whips Albert for stealing a small lump of sugar, at
about 11, A. M.; father usually came to dinner at 12, M.; Ally
cried for a long time; but he began to lull, and I was afraid he
wouldn’t hold out until father got home; so, I got Ally down cellar,
and pinched him, and pulled his hair, to make him keep it up,
until father got home; it being near twelve o’clock, and my step-mother
knowing my influence over Ally, told me if I would pacify
him before father came to dinner, she would give me as much sugar
as I wanted for a whole week; I accepted the bribe,—but Al
overheard us, and declared that he would cry like thunder, until
father came, if I didn’t give him half the sugar; we finally compromised,
by allowing Ally a quarter of all the lumps I got; a few
days after, while returning from a Saturday excursion down the
river, my brother Bill cut up so, that the boat capsized, in very
deep water, a short distance from the shore; Jim Baker and myself
got on the bottom of the boat, while Bill’s feet and head were
entangled in the ropes and sail; Sam Thurber and others swam to
the shore; Jim Baker and myself couldn’t swim, and we expected
to be lost; and we bellowed murder like fury; amid this awful
scene, the owner of the boat came down the shore, and cried:
“Pay for that boat, you rascals, pay for that boat;” he had scarcely
breathed these brutal words, when down went Jim Baker and
myself to the river’s bed; I rose to the surface first, and went
down again, when Jim grabbed my leg, and we came up together,
and a noble sailor seized and bore us to the shore, where we were
put in barrels, and pints of water squeezed out of us; Jim and myself
open our dewy eyes, shake hands, and walk home arm in arm,
with the sailor behind, thrashing the boat proprietor for demanding
pay, instead of coming to our rescue, whose unparalleled inhumanity
the gallant tar couldn’t tolerate. I went to bed, and had a
horrid night-mare, and dreamed of sharks and whales. On the
day after the boat calamity of Jim Baker and myself on Providence
river, I arose with the glorious sun, ate a spare repast, and
went to school. My stomach yet complained of salt water, and
my head and books were at rapiers’ points. The teacher, <span class='sc'>Shaw</span>,
vainly chides me for my indolence, and summons me before him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>and demands my spelling-book, and gives me <em>genuine</em>, which I
spell “<em>gen-ner-wine</em>.” The school is convulsed in the wildest
screams. Shaw seizes his lignumvitae ruler, darts through the
aisles, rolls his big gray eyes, and bangs the desks until the dust
rises into clouds, when the mirthful tumult is hushed into the
silence of a tomb, and he bids me take my seat, with furious cuffs
of both ears. My brother Bill had been snickering in his hat, and
sleeve, and handkerchief, until he had saturated them all with his
hilarious tears, and, as I passed him on my way to my seat, he
burst into a <em>genuine</em> Branch laugh, and all again was chaos. The
scholars were more uproarious than before, and Shaw rages furiously,
and calls up Bill, when all is silent terror, and every eye is
riveted on its book. Shaw demands Bill to extend his right hand,
which he declines to do, because he has a felon, and tender warts
all over his knuckles. Shaw then commands him to hold up his
left hand, and Bill obeys, when Shaw’s eyes flash sparks of fire, his
cheeks are deathly pale, and his ferule descends with tremendous
violence</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the vacant air,</div>
      <div class='line'>As Bill’s hand wan’t there!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The scholars roar again, and clap their little hands, and stamp
their feet in the wildest ecstacy, when Shaw bellows like a rabid
bull, and gesticulates fatality to the rebellious scholars, whose eyes
fall quickly on their books, and all violently move their pallid
lips, with pretense of study, while a terrible revenge rankles in
their hearts, for Shaw’s cruel treatment of Bill, who has so many
warts and a felon, with salt water still gurgling in his ocean belly.
At Shaw’s wrathful behest, Bill again raises his trembling hand,
and keeps his eye fastened on Shaw’s; and as the ruler nears his
palm, he dodges, when Shaw flies to his scholastic throne for his
cow-skin, and descends his ramparts with the pomposity of a king,
calmly surveying his juvenile and affrighted subjects, and directs
Bill to remove his jacket, who firmly declines. Shaw seizes him,
and Bill cries murder; the girls weep and faint, and water is
sprinkled on their cheeks and foreheads; the boys shake their
fists, and dare each other to rush to Bill’s rescue, but Shaw threatens
them with utter annihilation if they interfere, and the belligerent
and affrighted boys leave poor Bill to his unhappy fate.—Fortunately
for Bill, Shaw is short, and of very slender mould.
Bill is stout, knows well the physical weakness of his adversary,
and proves himself fully equal to the awful crisis before him. For,
while Shaw strives to get Bill across his knees to switch and spank
him, Bill, by a sudden and very elastic movement, gets between,
and coils himself, like a snake, around Shaw’s legs, and pinches,
and bites, and tears his pants, and finally trips him, and down they
go, with Bill on Shaw, and with both hands so firmly and desperately
clenched in Shaw’s white cravat, as to make his tongue protrude.
The girls faintly titter, while the stoutest and bravest boys
bang their desks, and wildly shout with joy. The panting combatants
spring to the floor, and, like two roosters, have a moment’s
respite; Shaw is pale, and trembles with shame, and relents, and
in feeble and broken accents, directs Bill to take his seat; the silence
of a Capulet pervades the school, when my tremendous
horse laugh breaks the calm; the scholars scream again with frantic
contortions; Shaw’s eyes roll like a demon’s, and his voice rises
high above the universal clamor, which slowly subsides, and all is
still again; Shaw then comes on tiptoe to my desk, and grabs and
drags me to the aisle, with one hand clutched in my throat, and
the other in my long hair, when I grab him in a tender spot, and
make him squeal; and so severe and unrelenting is my grasp, that
he gladly gives freedom to my throat and hair, and implores, in
tones of excruciating agony, to release my hands. I slowly do so,
when he re-seizes me, and, dragging me several feet by my hair,
kicks away the scuttle, and casts me headlong beneath the schoolhouse,
closing the scuttle over me; I can hardly sit upright in my
new abode; all is darkness; I smell the awful perfume of a dead
skunk; little mice squeal, and run over me, and nibble at my
mouth and nose, and big and hungry rats approach, and violently
attack me, which I keep at bay with my feet and hands, and hideous
yells, and they finally scamper to their holes, while a myriad
of mice remain to torment me; I chew tobacco, to drown my abject
sorrow; it is the first cud that ever graced my mouth; I cover
it with the fragment of a newspaper, to prevent my giddy exhiliration
through a too strong taste of tobacco; I soon got deathly sick,
and thump and scream for Shaw to let me out, who heeds not my
piteous cries; I am desperate, and resting my hands and feet on
the ground, I get an irresistible purchase, and with a mighty
movement of my back, I burst the scuttle with a tremendous
crash, and dart from my narrow and dreary cavern into the schoolroom,
and run down the aisle, vomiting at every step; the scholars
are nearly gone; as I approach the door, Shaw grabs me, when I
belch the purest bile plump in his face, which, of course, was purely
accidental; Shaw is blinded with tobacco bile, and wipes his
cheeks, and nose, and mouth, and eyes, and commands me to go to
his desk; I refuse; he then expostulates, and breathes kind words,
which allay my anger, and check the flow of tobacco and salt water
bile; I go to his desk; he dismisses the few scholars that remain,
save my weeping brother Bill, curled in the corner; Shaw
laments the sad occurrence; hopes we will be better boys, and
permits us to go home; on our arrival, father is at tea, listening to
brother Albert’s version of the story; Bill and myself seat ourselves
at table, when father directs each to give his melancholy
narrative; Bill is hungry, and slowly begins, and lacks vivacity,
and the impatient father turns to me for the rapid and vivid analysis
of the horrid scholastic anarchy and rencontre then flying on
exaggeration’s wide-spread wings, and distracting the peaceful
firesides of Providence; I swallow the delicious food already in
my mouth; cleanse my throat with a prolonged swallow of commingled
tea and sugar, and tell my story in a nervous strain; my
father’s eyes are large, and fixed on mine, throughout my exciting
narrative, at whose close, he gets his hat and cane and autumnal
mantle, and bids myself and Bill to follow him; we penetrate the
pitchy darkness, and after varied street meanderings in the turbulent
and piercing evening winds, we ascend the steps, and tap at
the door of Shaw; we enter his pale presence, who is extremely
courteous to father, who is a member of the Visiting School Committee,
and invested with power of a teacher’s dismissal, which
Shaw now fears; father opens his deadly batteries, and Shaw, perceiving
no possible escape, pleads extenuation for the violent temper
that nature gave him; spoke of William as a very good and
studious boy, (a truth,) and of Stephen as a meritorious and enthusiastic
youth, who dearly loved his books, (a lie,) and deeply
regretted that his heated passion led him to the chastisement of
William, and the incarceration of Stephen; and declared in tones
of warm sincerity, that if father would forgive him, he would never
whip nor imprison us again, but lead us up the hill of science
through gentle and persuasive means; father pities and admires
his humility, and, rising to depart, directs Shaw to inform him
every Friday by letter, how many days William and Stephen have
played the truant during the week, and with what facility we recite
our lessons, and what our general conduct is; Shaw’s eyes
flash joy at these delightful and magnanimous behests, while the
eyes of Bill and myself flash guilt and fury at Shaw’s apparent
conquest, because all our future sport is spoiled, and mine, especially,
as I played truant about twice a week, and Bill once a
month; and because I seldom got my lessons well; Shaw and father
extend their hands, and shake a warm good night: and while
they linger at the outer door in friendly conversation, I slyly
crawl through father’s legs, to get into the street as soon as possible,
and away from Shaw’s victorious presence; the last shake
of hands transpire between father and Shaw, who slowly closes
the door with a beatific smile; father, myself, and Bill muffle ourselves
in our fervent garments; it snows and blows very hard;
and, as we walk slowly homeward against the snow and wind,
father delivers an affectionate and mournful lecture, gently chiding
us for the trouble we had caused him, and the rapid increase of his
snowy locks; kindly warning us that we were constantly exposed
to the sad fate of orphans, our tender mother being already gone
forever; and with a trembling voice implored us to be good boys,
to study hard, to be kind and obedient to Mr. Shaw, to cultivate
manly virtues, and strive to become intellectual giants, and the
pillars of our country, in peace or war, after the fathers of his generation
had passed from the field of action. We both wept bitterly,
and besought our dear and indulgent father to forgive the past,
with assurances of our efforts to please him and our teacher in the
future. We reach home, and father kindles a crackling, hickory
fire, and gives us cider and walnuts, and tells us pretty stories, and
puts on extra bed clothes, because the night is so piercing cold, and
tucks our bed at the sides, to keep out the biting air, and then directs
us to clasp and raise our little hands to God, and say after him
our evening prayer of</p>

  <h2 id='alligator' class='c005'>The Alligator Lives for Another Week.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Ladies have saved the <span class='sc'>Alligator</span> for
six days more, in which God made the gorgeous
realms of infinitude! Last week, I proclaimed
that unless advance subscribers or patriots came
to the rescue of the wounded and bleeding <span class='sc'>Alligator</span>,
he must soon expire amid the tumultuous
exultations of his proscriptive adversaries.
The gentlemen responded in companies, but
the ladies in battalions, and soothed and rescued
the poor <span class='sc'>Alligator</span> from the jaws of immediate
death.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Without the sympathy of woman,
man soon droops, and totters, and expires.
Woman is the prolific source of all that glorifies
the cottages, and mansions, and palaces of
the globe. And her benevolence ameliorates
the poor, and oppressed, and disconsolate in
every region of the earth. From Eve to Mary,
the mother of Washington, the history of woman
is a brilliant constellation. Without the
pure and patriotic Mary, there would have been
no Washington,—and without Washington,
the Americans would have had no country, and
the oppressed of all lands no asylum of liberty
and prosperity. In the sacred bosom of her
family, woman is like the queen of night amid
the pretty stars. In our infant years, she nourishes,
and shields, and cheers us in our precarious
journey to maturer years. She imparts
the first kiss, and moulds the first prayer, and
is prouder of her offspring than a queen of her
throne. As the child buds, and blooms, and
blossoms, and ascends the hill of moral and
scholastic science, she watches every pace with
breathless solicitude. And in penury or affluence,
in bondage or freedom, in power or on
the scaffold, she clings with intense affection to
the adored objects of her creation. Every family
is a dominion. The father is a king, and
the mother a queen, and the children their subjects.
The same laws govern a family as a
kingdom. Judicious penalties follow disobedience,
and a good mother imbues the heart
and mind of her offspring with humanity and
wisdom that govern the world. And over all
presides a Being of beneficence and ubiquity,
who wields the destinies of a Universe. Woman,
under God, is the source of all that cheers
and ennobles man in his weary pilgrimage
from the cradle to the grave, and to her sympathies
am I greatly indebted for my recent
liberation from captivity and the partial resurrection
of my declining fortunes. God bless
her, then, and in my sacred orisons and soliloquies,
on land or ocean, I will ever cherish her
with those grateful emotions that I inherited
from the genial heart of my departed mother.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST LESSON.</h3>

<p class='c013'><i>Stephen.</i>—What do you first wish to learn?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Pupil.</i>—I desire first to review my figures.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How far have you cyphered?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I went through the book several times, when I was a boy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Whose Arithmetic did you study?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Mr. Dollbay’s.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Daboll’s, I suppose, you mean.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, it was Daboll’s; and I remember him very well.
He was a fine man, and understood figures very well.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Then you went through his book several times?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—O yes, I can take my oath of that.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How much is twice nothing?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—That is two, of course.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How much is nothing times two?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—That is two.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How much is one-half times one?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How much is four and a-half times four and a-half?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i> (scratching his head)—That must be about thirteen.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How much is three-quarters times five-eights?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I never saw that in Daboll, and to be candid, Mr. Branch, I
have long been accustomed to rush of blood to the head, and I
had a slight rush just now, and I guess I won’t go any farther in
figures to-day; but I would like to renew my Grammar studies.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Very well: whose Grammar did you study in boyhood?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Mr. Murphy’s.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I presume you mean Lindley Murray’s?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, it was Murray’s, and he once dined at my father’s.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—As it is absolutely essential to understand spelling, before
Grammar, I will first examine you in a few words, before we embark
in Grammar. Can you spell well, sir?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Yes; and I hope you don’t mean to insult me with such a
question.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Certainly not. Spell Grammar?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Gramer.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Gramar.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—How do yau spell it, then?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Grammar.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—That’s the way I spelt it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No, sir.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—If I didd’t, I intended to.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—That may be. Spell sloop?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Slupe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—That’s the way old Captain Tallman spelt it, when I was a
boy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—It is spelt sloop in these days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, that’s correct, I remember.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell dough?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Doe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—My grandmother used to spell it so.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—It is spelt dough.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell God?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Gorde.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i> (is silent for some seconds, and grows pale, and sweats profusely)—Merciful
Heaven! And do you say Gorde is incorrect?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I do. It is spelt God.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, I was mistaken. That’s the way I have always
spelt it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell scholar?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Skoller.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Skollar.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—That’s the way I always spelt it, and I’ll bet a dollar that’s
the way to spell it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—That’s a bet.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—How shall we decide it?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Have you got a dictionary?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Yes. (Examines it.) Well, I declare, you have won the dollar.
What a curious way to spell scholar, to put <em>ch</em> for <em>k</em>. Mr.
Branch: who invented language?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—The Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—What old fools they must have been?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Those Egyptians who discovered the alphabet, were the
wisest linguists of the human race. And those Arabians who discovered
the digits, were the profoundest mathematicians. And,
as you can neither spell nor cypher well, I advise you to defer your
arithmetic and grammar lessons until you learn orthography.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I don’t know what you mean by linguist, nor by digits.
And what on earth do you mean by orthography?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Orthography means spelling.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, I thought that was it. Now, Mr. Branch, I am in
public life, as you know, and I am very anxious to make a good
speech and write a good letter; and, in order to do that, I must
understand Grammar. And I think I can spell well enough to
study Grammar, Mr. Branch. You have only examined me in a
few words, and because I slightly broke down on them, you must
not suppose that I can’t spell well enough to study Grammar.
Just try me in a few more words.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell alderman?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Oldermon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Olldermone.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—How, then?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Alderman.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes. That’s the way I was just agoing to spell it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell Common Council?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Komon Kounsil.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No, sir. It is spelt Common Council.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Is it possible?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Yes. And now spell municipal?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Dam if I don’t give that up; for, although I have been a
member of the municiple government, I nover could spell that
awful word without looking at the dictionary two or three times;
and it always took me a mighty long time to find municiple, even
in the dictionary. Now, do try me on some easier word than that,—won’t
you, Mr. Branch?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell Mayor?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Mare.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—How, then?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Mayor.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes,—I forgot. That’s it exactly.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell contracts?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I can spell that fast enough. Kontrax.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Kontracks.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No. It is spelt contracts.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I begin to think my memory is getting bad, for I once could
spell all these words. And I have had so many contracts from the
Corporation, and have written that word so often, that I am sure
I used to spell it correctly. Now give me one more easy word,
and if I break down, dam if I don’t surrender.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Spell Cable?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I have got a few shares in that precious stock, and I’ll bet $5
I can spell it correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Done.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Kabell.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No. It is spelt cable.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—There’s a V. And now, although I have spelt several words
incorrectly, yet, as I am growing old, I desire to learn as fast as
possible; and I want you to give me grammar lessons and teach
me spelling at the same time. And if you will learn me very fast,
I will let you have one share in the Atlantic Cable, for your instructions.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I would rather have the cash, as I cannot believe that a cord
about the circumference of my thumb can permanently connect
the hemispheres.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Very well, sir. I have perfect confidence in the Cable enterprise,
and I don’t care about parting with my stock. So I will
pay you in cash for your tuition. Now please give me a lesson in
grammar.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Well, I will strive to gratify you,—although I again assure
you, that orthography is the basis of grammar, and we shall encounter
ruinous obstacles in the construction of the grammatical
pyramid, in the absence of orthography and orthœpy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—For the land’s sake, what is the meaning of the last word?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Orthœpy means pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—How queer your jaw opens and closes, when you pronounce
that strange word.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I suppose so. I will now give you the first lesson in grammar.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Let me first take a good stiff horn of brandy to brace my
nerves. (Drinks.) Now, sir, I am ready for Grammar, which, I
repeat, I studied when a boy; and I only desire to review what I
know already.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—How many parts of speech are there?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I mean, into how many parts of speech is language divided?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Well, by golly, I don’t know exactly,—but, from the immense
number of words in the Bible, and in all the books at the
Harpers, and in the Historical Society, and in all the newspapers,
I should think there must be, at the lowest calculation, about five
hundred million parts of speech.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—There are only nine parts of speech.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—I begin to think you are crazy; for, do you think you can
humbug me by saying that there are only nine different words, or
parts of speech, in the English language? I shall consider it to
be my duty to have you put in the Lunatic Asylum, if you talk in
that way.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—I still assert that there are only nine parts of speech, which
are: a noun, article, adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb, preposition,
conjunction, and interjection.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, I recollect.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Well, what part of speech is iron?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—As near as I can recollect, iron is the seventh, and it may
possibly be the ninth part of speech.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—No, sir,—it is one of the nine parts of speech I just mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, excuse me,—I understand. Well, iron must be a
conjunction, because it can be heated and spliced.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—Iron is a noun.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Ah, yes, I recollect perfectly well that iron is a noun, and I
am surprised that I did not remember it, as I have long dealt in
fron, and know all about it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>S.</i>—That will do for to-day, and I will resume your grammar lessons
to-morrow. Good day, sir.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>P.</i>—Good day. I am much pleased wite my progress in grammar,
and I will see you again to-morrow with much pleasure.
Good day, sir.</p>

    <div><i>A lovely Family, at the iron door, peeping through its small perforations.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><i>The Father.</i>—What is your name, sir?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—My name is Branch.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—For what are you confined?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—For an alleged libel.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—On whom?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—On Mayor Daniel F. Tiemann, Simeon Draper, and
Isaac Bell, Jr.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—What is the period of your imprisonment?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—One year. I think I have seen you before. What
is your name, sir?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—H——d.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Where do you reside?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—In Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Ah! The dearest associations of my life are connected
with two students bearing your name, who were from
Charleston.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—My wife and children: I think the keeper has directed
us to the Lunatic Asylum, instead of the abode of convicts. Let
us go and ask the keeper to show us to the prison.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Stop, sir. I now most positively discern the relics of
your early features. Were you a student at Cambridge in 1835?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—I was.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—And your brother also, who was rescued from a
watery grave in Boston Harbor?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father</i> (<i>leans against the iron door, and his frame trembles,
and his face assumes a deathly palor</i>).—God of Heaven! And
are you the son of Judge Stephen Branch, of Providence, Rhode
Island?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—I am, sir.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father</i> (<i>wiping sweat from his forehead and tears from his
cheeks</i>).—Dear Stephen: Give me your hand, after our long separation.
Alas! my poor brother is dead, whose life you saved in
that dreadful squall, in Boston Harbor, twenty-three years ago.
(<i>All weep, and his eldest daughter sobs aloud.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Where and when did your noble brother die?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—In Switzerland, ten years since; and in his last days
he spoke most kindly of you.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>His Wife</i> (<i>in profuse tears</i>).—Have you a wife, Mr. Branch?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Neither wife, nor child, nor parents, nor hardly a
relative on earth. And I am glad they have gone down to their
happy graves. And I almost wish that I was reposing by their
side. The earth is no place for me, nor for those who expose the
licentious officials and plundering monsters of this age, who allure
spotless females into the horrors of prostitution, and drive the
friendless masses into cellars and attics and crowded and pestilential
habitations, and into the inclement atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wife.</i>—But why rejoice over the eternal departure of nearly all
your kindred?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Because it would have blighted their health and fondest
hopes to have beheld me in a felon’s dungeon.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wife.</i>—But you have committed no crime?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—I could not do that. And I am in prison, because I
have exposed the crimes, and resisted the gilded bribes of official
plunderers for a dozen years, and utterly refused to join them in
their various deeds of infamy. I could have been affluent, and
had my liberty, if I had joined the public thieves, and shared their
plunder. And if my parents were alive, although they would rejoice
at my exposure of vicious public men, yet they would weep
over the cruelty of those who consigned me to this dungeon, without
an honorable trial, and rudely thrust me into the chain-gang
of the quarries, and even yearn for my life.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wife.</i>—Yours seems a hard fate?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Yes; mine is indeed a mournful destiny.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Her Eldest Daughter</i> (<i>whose lovely eyes gleam with tears</i>).—I
weep over your misfortunes. I have often heard my dear uncle,
whose life you saved at the peril of your own, speak of you in
tones of deep affection, and here is a diamond breastpin he gave
me in Switzerland, on the Lake of Geneva, on a tranquil moonlight
evening, only ten days before his soul’s departure for the
spirit realms. Take it, dear Mr. Branch, and keep it in remembrance
of his affectionate niece. To no other being would I present
a sacred gift of my departed uncle.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen</i> (<i>with overwhelming emotion</i>).—Please accept my profoundest
gratitude for your precious donation, which I will wear
near a heart that dearly loved your departed uncle, with whom I
passed some of the happiest hours of my life.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The Youngest Daughter</i> (<i>who is about ten years old</i>).—Dear
Mr. Branch: Will you take this sweet rose from me, and let me
kiss you through the grate?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—O God! This is too much for my poor nerves. (<i>I
shed copious tears, and all weep.</i>) Yes, my pretty little girl, you
can kiss me through the grate. (<i>And her father holds her up,
and I place my pale, and cold, and haggard cheek to a perforation
of my cell door, and this affectionate little girl imprints a
fervent kiss, which I cordially reciprocate.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—God has blessed me with great prosperity, and I will
devote my fortune to your restoration to liberty.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Mr. Ashmead, my able and faithful Counsel, assures
me that I will soon emerge from prison, through the Supreme Judiciary.
I most sincerely thank you for your extraordinary generosity,
and for the visit of yourself and wife, and daughters, whom
I will cherish all my days.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—When you obtain your liberty, you must come to
Charleston, where you will be received with our warmest hospitality.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wife.</i>—If you come, you shall never leave us.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Eldest Daughter.</i>—You shall have the vacant seat of my uncle
at our table.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><i>Youngest Daughter.</i>—Yes; and I will kiss you again—won’t I
mother?—when you come to Charleston.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mother.</i>—Yes, my dear child; and you shall give him the sweetest
rose in our garden.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Youngest Daughter.</i>—That I will, and pretty flowers, too.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Father.</i>—Good by, Mr. Branch. (<i>Strives to get his hand
through the perforated door, but can clasp my fingers with but
two of his.</i>) Good by, sir—good by.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Wife.</i>—Good by, Mr. Branch. I hope you will be restored to
freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Eldest Daughter.</i>—Good by, Mr. Branch. I shall think of you
with kindness, after I am gone, and I shall yearn to see you at our
home in Carolina.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Youngest Daughter.</i>—Good by, dear Mr. Branch, and I want
you to give me another kiss before I go. (<i>I kiss her, and receive
many in return.</i>) Good by, and you must not forget to come to
Charleston, when these bad men let you out of prison. Good by,
dear Mr. Branch, and I hope you will not be lonely and cry much
after we have gone far away from you. Good by, Mr. Branch.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Stephen.</i>—Farewell, kind friends, and may God ever bless you
for your noble sympathy. (<i>All go, and I prostrate myself on my
cot, and am in prayers and tears long after their mournful departure.</i>)</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Earth lies dumb before me, and the shadows</div>
      <div class='line'>Of midnight cast their dim forms athwart it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Quiet is brooding o’er a silent world,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the soft hush of slumber seals each lid.</div>
      <div class='line'>Night is too fair for sleep: with me thought wakes</div>
      <div class='line'>And treads in distant paths, where human step</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne’er left an echo on the vacant air.</div>
      <div class='line'>The gorgeous canopy of heaven is wrapped</div>
      <div class='line'>In silvery haze: Gems of uncounted wealth</div>
      <div class='line'>Bestud the lofty concave; and the bright</div>
      <div class='line'>Moon seems rolling like a silvery ball</div>
      <div class='line'>Across the trackless æther, mantling the earth</div>
      <div class='line'>In glory;—while her mellowed light</div>
      <div class='line'>Falls on my spirit with a holy calm, like that</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heaven. Tell us—why are we chained to earth?</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis far too gross for the immortal mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which yearns for higher realms, and pants in vain</div>
      <div class='line'>For the full measure of perfection. Oh!</div>
      <div class='line'>I have gazed upon night’s starry volume,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till I have read long lessons of delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drank the raptures of another world.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thought, living thought, burns to embrace the whole</div>
      <div class='line'>Of those deep mysteries eternity</div>
      <div class='line'>Conceals from mortal understanding; and</div>
      <div class='line'>The mind speaks out, and questions every beam</div>
      <div class='line'>Which falls from the bright reservoir of heaven—</div>
      <div class='line'>Interrogates each plant and breathing thing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Retires within itself, and calls up every</div>
      <div class='line'>Faculty—sends powerful fancy forth to</div>
      <div class='line'>Search through untrod regions, but spends its pow’rs</div>
      <div class='line'>Unsatisfied, till it sinks down at last</div>
      <div class='line'>Exhausted by its own intensity.</div>

favor of a Convention, the words: “Shall there be a Convention
to Revise the Constitution and amend the same? Yes.” And by
those voters who are opposed thereto, the words: “Shall there be

to such convention, and shall also state in words, at full length,
the whole number of ballots having thereon the words, “Shall
there be a Convention to revise the Constitution and amend the

stating the day on which, and the number of the district, the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
